<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D. student at the School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, supervised by [Prof. Zhu Wang(王柱)](https://jszy.nwpu.edu.cn/wangzhu.html). My research interests include mmWave sensing and wireless sensing foundation model. I currently serve as a reviewer for top-tier international conferences and journals, including ACM UbiComp/ISWC 2024 and IEEE Internet of Things Journal. Additionally, I am a TPC member for MobiCom 2025 Artifact Evaluation.
